# APIs - Recap

## Introduction

In this section, you learned about the HTTP request/response cycle and using APIs. APIs are critical to software development, and they can be powerful tools for gathering data for data scientists.

## Key Takeaways

APIs can provide access to a wide range of data that you might need as a data scientist.

Key takeaways include:

* While there are many other kinds of APIs, as a data scientist, you'll typically be working with web APIs.
* The `requests` library in Python is a great starting point for making HTTP requests to APIs.
* Most APIs you encounter will return results in JSON format.
* The two most common HTTP methods you'll use when accessing APIs are `GET` (to retrieve information) and `POST` (to send information).
* Typically, you'll need to authenticate in some manner to gain access to most APIs - one common method for doing so is using OAuth.
