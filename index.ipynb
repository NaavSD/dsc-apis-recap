    "In this section, you learned about the HTTP request/response cycle and using APIs. APIs are critical to software development, and they can be powerful tools for gathering data for data scientists.\n",

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs can provide access to a wide range of data that you might need as a data scientist.\n",

    "Key takeaways include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* While there are many other kinds of APIs, as a data scientist, you'll typically be working with web APIs.\n",
    "* The `requests` library in Python is a great starting point for making HTTP requests to APIs.\n",
    "* Most APIs you encounter will return results in JSON format.\n",
    "* The two most common HTTP methods you'll use when accessing APIs are `GET` (to retrieve information) and `POST` (to send information).\n",
    "* Typically, you'll need to authenticate in some manner to gain access to most APIs - one common method for doing so is using OAuth. "
